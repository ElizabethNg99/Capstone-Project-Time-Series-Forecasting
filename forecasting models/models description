We have used several models trying to forecast the overall energy usage by household using the dataset from kaggle

Kaggle dataset url: https://www.kaggle.com/taranvee/smart-home-dataset-with-weather-information

Models used:
1. Naive method
2. Simple moving average forecasting method
3. Exponential weighted moving average forecasting method
4. Holts and Holts-Winter method
5. ARIMA model
6. SARIMA model
7. Multilayer perceptron neural network

The rmse loss for each model that we build are stated below:
1. Naive method                                                                    5.86
2. Simple moving average forecasting method (for 14 days)                          5.16
3. Exponential weighted moving average forecasting method (for 14 days)            5.03
4. Holts and Holts-Winter method                                                   7.69
5. ARIMA model                                                                     7.08
6. SARIMA model                                                                   42.37
7. Multilayer perceptron neural network                                            5.77
